Zig runs code at compile time rather than run time
Zig does have a compiler that is capable of making inferences and creates variable types created by the compiler itself 
anything with pub is allowed allowed to imported in other modulees 
"switch" uses 3 ... while the a range uses 2 .. that because switch cases are inclusive of both numbers 
for is exclusive of the upper bound
the difference between return and break is that we have the "break works by returning the value based and exiting code"
"return" is used to exit a function and return a value making the code more readable and flexible
compile time is when the code is converted to machine code 
runtime is is the period when code in the program is actually running
